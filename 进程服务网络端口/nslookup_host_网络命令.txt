Non-authoritative answer:
redhat.com	mail exchanger = 10 mx2.redhat.com.
redhat.com	mail exchanger = 5 mx1.redhat.com.

Authoritative answers can be found from:
mx2.redhat.com	internet address = 66.187.233.33
mx1.redhat.com	internet address = 209.132.183.28

In the above example, we have 2 MX records for the domain “redhat.com”. The number ( 5, 10 ), associated with the MX records tells the preference of mail server. Lower the number, higher the preference. So when a mail is sent to “@redhat.com”, first preference will be “mx1.redhat.com”, then “mx2.redhat.com”.

Authoritative Answer vs Non-Authoritative Answer
You may also noticed the keyword “Authoritative Answer” and “Non-Authoritative Answer” in the above output.
Any answer that originates from the DNS Server which has the complete zone file information available for the domain is said to be authoritative answer.
In many cases, DNS servers will not have the complete zone file information available for a given domain. Instead, it maintains a cache file which has the results of all queries performed in the past for which it has gotten authoritative response. When a DNS query is given, it searches the cache file, and return the information available as “Non-Authoritative Answer”.
